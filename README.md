## Refactoring List

1. Run with coverage.
2. Rename variable `url` to `urlToTOC` - enables better understanding of the variable's purpose.
3. Remove dead/commented code - improves code clarity and maintainability.
4. Remove the cast to Element - unnecessary and clutters the code.
5. [Decompose conditional] - extract conditional code to clearly named method.
